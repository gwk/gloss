# Development
* Press `F5` to launch a new instance of the editor with the extension loaded.
* If it does not work the first time then you may need to go to the debug mode (click the bug icon in the left toolbar of VSCode), and launch it with the GUI controls at the top of the pane.
* In the debug instance, select `File > Preferences > Color Themes` and pick `gloss-black`.
* Changes can be reloaded with `Cmd+R` from the debug instance.

# Installation
* To start using your extension with Visual Studio Code copy it into the `~/.vscode/extensions` folder and restart Code.
* To share your extension with the world, read on https://code.visualstudio.com/docs about publishing an extension.
